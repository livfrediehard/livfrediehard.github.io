“Why did you decide to study Software Engineering?”

For the exact reason of my hashtag, I felt my dreams of supporting a family, having a house with a garage and fixing up my dad's 63 Vette were getting further and further out of touch. I needed to protect them. Here is my short story of my journey.


For years I have built computers, loved tech and kept quiet an array of apps on my phone. I believe in technology with all my existence and that it can change the world. Programming interested me,  but it also scared me. A new language? Writing technoology? Looking at the Matrix most of the day? Sounds intense, can I take the blue pill instead?

I have worked in hospitality for almost 10 years and always saw it as a means to an end. In high school it was free food. In college it was good tips. In my professional life it was management experience. But, now that I look back… was that really what I wanted to do? No, it absolutely wasn’t! My joys in life are computers, cars, mountain bikes and woodworking. I often do some woodworking and mountain biking on the weekends and cars is more of a fascination and keeping up with the newest McLearen or if Ford is ever going to release their Bronco. Computers were a true love and I even remember back to the days of building computers with my pops when I was just in middle school.

Software Engineering to me was an easy decision and it honestly excited me to finally realize that I could actually do something that was a creative outlet for change. I researched going back to FIU for a CS degree, a few bootcamps and then the good ole “self taught” route. At the end of the day I came up with a simple equation to knock out my choices.

The variables were time and money vs outcome.

-CS degree would have taken too long and was too expensive. It also did not purely concentrate on programming.

-Self taught was the economical route, but could require the most time with the bonus of frustration.

-Bootcamps seem to make the most sense. They were affordable, had several options of time and had career services to help with the job search.

At the end of the day I was between a few different bootcamps. There were: UM Bootcamp (local university in Miami, Thinkful, Ironhack and Flatiron. A did a pros, cons and cost comparison for all the software engineering programs they had and Flatiron ended up winning the bid. They were affordable, fit my schedule and even had a scholarship program for students affected by Covid-19.

It’s a tough decision to change your careers and even your future for that matter. These are tough times for everybody, but at the end of the day you have to survive. You have to want more for yourself and the future. That drive, knowing that I will have a career that I actually enjoy and be able to provide for my family outweighs every shred of doubt in my mind. I am ready to protect my dreams.
